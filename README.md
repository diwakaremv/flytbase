`diwakar.py` contains the code for square navigation of drone (app 1)   
`diwakar2.py` contains the code for triangular navigation of drone (app 2)


Note: There was probably a bug in GCS that was constantly changing the altitude of drone. Even in default demo apps too, the bug was visible. I also mentioned it in the email.
